## 2. Introduction
*The introduction should motivate your work: what is your topic? What question(s) are you trying to answer with your analysis? Why is answering those questions important?*


A secure, affordable house is a typical goal that people have in their lives. Many people would make monthly deposits to their savings account or get loans from the bank to buy a house so that they have a place of comfort. California is well known for its contributions to the country's economy, its technology industry, high income, and its beautiful scenery across the coast. Furthermore, its house price is also pretty high. Thus, this leads us to question, can we determine the median house value of a block based on the location and socioeconomic factors of income and age? This question is particularly useful for real estate investors to find undervalued properties and for people who are plan to purchase a house in CA to gain a better understanding of the affordability.

## 3. Data Curation
*Cite the source(s) of your data. Explain what it is. Transform the data so that it is ready for analysis. For example, set up a database and use SQL to query for data, or organize a pandas DataFrame.*

**Source:** [Link to your data source]

[Describe your cleaning process here.]

```python
# Optional: Paste your data loading/cleaning code here
import pandas as pd
# df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
